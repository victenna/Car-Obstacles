Simple Car Game is a school mini-project project developed in Python 3 using Pygame module (less than 70 lines of code). 
Player goal is to avoid crashing obstacles. Control of the car motion is realized with left and right keyboard arrow buttons.
Whenever the car touches obstacle, it is crashed and motion starts from the beginning (bottom end of the display screen).
The files for modeling this scenario can be downloaded free of charge at:
